        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>Bento is a traditional, single-portioned Japanese lunch box. It is common for (and, to a point, expected that) mothers make bento for their children.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup cooked white rice</li>
                <li>1 umeboshi</li>
                <li>1 shishamo</li>
                <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>Handful frozen edamame</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sakura denbu</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Put cooked rice in your bento box about 3/4 of the way full (leave some room at the top for your toppings and to be able to put the lid on).</li>
                <li>Take 1 umeboshi and put it on one side of the rice.</li>
                <li>In a small pan, heat the oil on medium-high. Cook one shishamo on both sides until cooked.</li>
                <li>Place the cooked shishamo across the middle of the bento box on the rice.</li>
                <li>Boil water in a small pot. Put in a handful of frozen edamame and cook according to package instructions.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, pop the edamame beans out of the pod. Arrange them on the rice to fill up a little less than one quarter of the bento box, under the shishamo.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the sakura denbu on the rice next to the edamame.</li>
                <li>Enjoy whenever it's lunch time! Put a lid on it and pack it away to take with you.</li>
            </ol>
