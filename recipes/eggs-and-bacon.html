        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p class="desc">The combination that is bacon-and-eggs is unrivaled in the category of Best Basic Breakfasts. Here's a quick how-to that will satisfy the morning munchies, as well as (hopefully) keep you in the good graces of any resident fire demons.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>4 slices of bacon</li>
                <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
                <li>1 tsp thyme</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat pan and add bacon, letting the bacon fat act as grease. Cook until desired cripiness.</li>
                <li>Chop onion into thin slices, and heat oil in a large skillet on medium-high until sizzling. Add onions, and cook until clear and soft.</li>
                <li>Season onions with thyme and salt and let cook. Add red wine and vinegar and cook for about another minute.</li>
                <li>In the same pan as the onions, add eggs, and cook 2-3 minutes or until crispy on the bottom and the white is cooked.</li>
                <li>Remove eggs and onion from pan, and serve with bacon.</li>
            </ol>
