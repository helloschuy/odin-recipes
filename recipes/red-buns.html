        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>Red Bean Paste Prep:
                <li>Wash the red beans and soak the dried red beans at least 8 hours or overnight. Longer soaking time can shorten the cooking time.</li>
                <li>Drain and add around 3 cups of water in a high pressure cooker along with the beans.</li>
                <li>Cook the beans for around 40 minutes or until quite soft.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <ol>Smashed Beans Option:
                <li>Smash the beans with a hard spatula. Add sugar and heat over slow fire to cook off extra water until form a paste texture. Stir from time to time during the process.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>Smooth Beans Option:
                <li>Press the cooked mixture with a spatula through a fine strain to remove the skins to get the smoothest texture. Or if you prefer to keep the skin, transfer all the content to a food processor and blend to a smooth consistency.</li>
                <li>Transfer the paste to a pan. Add salt, sugar and butter. Use low fire to simmer the exceeded water out. Keep stirring during the process until the paste can sticky together.</li>
                <li>Wait for the paste to cool down.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>Making the Bun:
                <li>In a stand mixer, place all of the dough ingredients (without the bean paste) in and then knead for 6-8 minutes at slow speed.</li>
                <li>Shape the dough into a ball and set aside in warm place for 1 hour or until double in size (the time needed is very much depending on your room temperature).</li>
                <li>Add around 2 tablespoons of flour in the dough and continue kneading the dough for 2 minutes at low speed in a stand mixer.</li>
                <li>Then transfer out and divide the dough into 6 or 8 portions. Shape each portion to a round ball. Press it to a wrapper with thin edges and thicker center. Place around 1.5 tablespoon of red bean fillings in center. Seal completely and turn over and shape it into a dome.</li>
                <li>Place the buns on baking papers and then place in steamer. Cover the lid and rest for another 15 to 20 minutes at a room temperature around 28 degree C to 30 degree C. In cold water days, heat water in a pot for several minutes until warm but not boiling and then place the steamer on the warm water, rest for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Re-steam the buns if they are cooled. No changes for the taste.</li>
