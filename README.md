# odinrecipes
My first coding project with the odin project oh boy!

Pre-Thoughts - 09/07/2022

This is the first assignment in The Odin Project's foundations course, the end product of which is a basic recipes website. By the end of this project, I hope to have demostrated my abilities to use basic tags, embed images, and use links to allow a user to effectively navigate my website. I also hope to gain a firmer grasp on using git in the command line and writing commit messages.

Post Thoughts - 09/09/2022

I definitely need to map out my pages and what links where on paper next time; I feel like I made too many changes and commits that could have been avoided just by being more thoughtful. 

I achieved the goals I outlined in the pre-thoughts sections, and am especiially pleased with how satisfying it is to use the command line. I look forward to further solidifying that skill in future projects.

Also, later, will call it: Howl's Moving Cookbook
